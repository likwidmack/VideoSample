00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:40.467
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, IMMIGRATION, 
 

65
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.200
EDUCATION, COMMON CORE, THOSE 
 

66

ISSUES, GUESS WHAT?
 

72
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.967
THEY COULD REALLY BURN HIM. 
 

73
00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:51.400
&gt;&gt; AS WE ROLL THROUGH THE 
 

74
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.166
NUMBERS, MITT ROMNEY LOOKS LIKE 
 

75
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.433
AS A 2016, APPARENTLY, HE IS 
 

76
00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.266
REALLY CONSIDERING IT?
 

77
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.533
&gt;&gt; I TELL YOU THOUGH, THIS IS 
 

78
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.900
ANOTHER IMPACT OF JEB BUSH'S

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.300
EARLY DECISION, I THINK THIS 
 

80
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.133
TAKES ALL THE AIR OUT OF THIS 
 

81

QUIET BALLOON THAT WAS INFLATING
 

82

DONORS THAT SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT,
 

84
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.500
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST RALLY 
 

85
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.300
AROUND ROMNEY. 
 

86
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.033
BUT JEB GETTING IN, I THINK THIS
 

87
00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:13.467
DRIES UP THE ROMNEY SUPPORT. 
 

88
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.633
&gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS. 
 

89

DIFFERENT THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
 

107
00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:39.767
&gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING TO BE HER
